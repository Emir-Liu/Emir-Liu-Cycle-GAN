## Training
```
./download_dataset <dataset_name>
```
Valid <dataset_name> are: apple2orange, summer2winter_yosemite, horse2zebra, monet2photo, cezanne2photo, ukiyoe2photo, vangogh2photo, maps, cityscapes, facades, iphone2dslr_flower, ae_photos

Alternatively you can build your own dataset by setting up the following directory structure:

    .
    ├── datasets                   
    |   ├── <dataset_name>         # i.e. brucewayne2batman
    |   |   ├── train              # Training
    |   |   |   ├── A              # Contains domain A images (i.e. Bruce Wayne)
    |   |   |   └── B              # Contains domain B images (i.e. Batman)
    |   |   └── test               # Testing
    |   |   |   ├── A              # Contains domain A images (i.e. Bruce Wayne)
    |   |   |   └── B              # Contains domain B images (i.e. Batman)
    
### 2. Train!
```
./train --dataroot datasets/<dataset_name>/ --cuda
```
This command will start a training session using the images under the *dataroot/train* directory with the hyperparameters that showed best results according to CycleGAN authors. You are free to change those hyperparameters, see ```./train --help``` for a description of those.

Both generators and discriminators weights will be saved under the output directory.

If you don't own a GPU remove the --cuda option, although I advise you to get one!

You can also view the training progress as well as live output images by running ```python3 -m visdom``` in another terminal and opening [http://localhost:8097/](http://localhost:8097/) in your favourite web browser. This should generate training loss progress as shown below (default params, horse2zebra dataset):

## Testing
```
./test --dataroot datasets/<dataset_name>/ --cuda
```
This command will take the images under the *dataroot/test* directory, run them through the generators and save the output under the *output/A* and *output/B* directories. As with train, some parameters like the weights to load, can be tweaked, see ```./test --help``` for more information.
